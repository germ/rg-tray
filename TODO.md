As with any new project, there's a ton of stuff that still needs to be done.

As it stands, here's a list of stuff that works in rg-tray
- Loading the specified conf (or default.json)
- Enabling/Disabling all devices lighting

Todo:
- Implement a way to choose different schemes
- Extend the go-razer package with additional features if needed
- Live preview in web editor
- Maybe a simple "push the colored button" approach to mapping
  new layouts for RazerGenie?

Would-likes:
- Transforming device specfic layouts into generic-ised formats
- Web based frontend for sharing/testing schemes
- Palette generation
- Clean up the JSON parsing into idomatic Go
